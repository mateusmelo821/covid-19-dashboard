# covid-19-dashboard

This a data science project that made use of some datasets containing information about the covid-19 cases around the world to generate an interactive analytics deashboard. In this project, I have made use of tools like Python (pandas, numpy, plotly and Dash), Jupyter notebooks, git and github pages. The project with its main steps can be accessed [here](https://mateusmelo821.github.io/covid-19-dashboard/). A python code that generates a local dashboard can be accesses in the generate_dashboard.py file.
